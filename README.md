# English to Bangla Dictionary for Amazon Kindle

## Why I Made This Dictionary
When I got my first kindle on my hand, I tried to find an English to Bengali/Bangla dictionary for my **kindle** for free. But there wasn't any * *English to Bangla* * dictionary available for kindle devices. Then I stuck with the idea to make one for myself. I got an article on making mobipocket dictionary for any language on [mobileread.com](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=20480). Then I grabbed an * *English to Bangla* * dictionary database and converted it to mobipocket dictionary for **Bangla** language.

## How to Install
- Download the latest release file from **Release** tab or by visiting [here](https://github.com/igeniusarnob/kindle-en-bn-dictionary/releases). Current latest build is version 1.0 `Kindle_English_Bangla_Dictionary_Arnob_Karmokar_v1.0.zip`
- Extract the downloaded zip file.
- Connect your kindle to your pc via USB Cable.
- Copy the extracted file to your kindle's *Documents > Dictionary* folder.

## Updates
I will try to update this dictionary atleast once in three months with new words and corrections.

## Support
This dictionary is tested with *All New Kindle Basic 10th Generation*. This should also work with any other kindle. Please let me know if you face any problem. Thank You!
